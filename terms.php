        <h3>DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION </h3>
        <p>We each agree to first contact each other with any disputes and provide a written description of the problem, all relevant documents/information, and the proposed resolution.</p><br>
        <h3>Instead Of Suing In Court, We Each Agree To Arbitrate Disputes</h3>
        <p>We each agree to finally settle all disputes (as defined and subject to any specific exceptions below) only by arbitration. In arbitration, there is no judge or jury and review is limited. However, just as a court would, the arbitrator must honor the terms and conditions in this Agreement, the Terms of Use, and the Privacy Statement, and can award the same damages and relief, including any attorney&rsquo;s fees authorized by law. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;FAA&rdquo;), and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. We also each agree as follows: </p><br>
        <p>&ldquo;Disputes&rdquo; are any claims (including the definition of &ldquo;claims&rdquo; contained in the section Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranty above) or controversies against each other related in any way to this Agreement, the Terms of Use, the Privacy Statement, or Your purchase and use of the Product. This includes claims You bring against Our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, independent contractors, telecommunications providers, or agents or other representatives, or that <?php echo $config['product_name'];?>, brings against You.</p><br>
        <p>If either <?php echo $config['product_name'];?>, or You wants to arbitrate a dispute, We each agree to send written notice to the other providing a description of the dispute, previous efforts to resolve the dispute, all supporting documents/information, and the proposed resolution. Notice to You will be sent to Your billing address that You provided Us and notice to Us will be sent to: <?php echo $config['product_name'];?>. We each agree to make attempts to resolve this dispute within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the notice to arbitrate, then We may submit the dispute to formal arbitration. The FAA applies to this Agreement and arbitration provision. We each agree that the FAA&rsquo;s provisions, not state law, govern all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.</p><br>
        <p>The arbitration will be administered by the National Arbitration Forum (&ldquo;NAF&rdquo;) under its arbitration rules. If any NAF rule conflicts with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement apply. You can obtain procedures, rules, and fee information from the NAF at 1-800-474-2371 or www.adrforum.com. Unless We each agree otherwise, the Arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and will take place in the state of Your last billing address. The federal or state law that applies to the Agreement will also apply during the Arbitration. </p><br>
        <p>We each agree not to pursue arbitration on a consolidated or class-wide basis. We each agree that any arbitration will be solely between You and <?php echo $config['product_name'];?>, (not brought on behalf of or together with another individual&rsquo;s claim). If for any reason any court or arbitrator hold that this restriction in unconscionable or unenforceable, then this agreement to arbitrate does not apply and the dispute must be brought in court.</p><br>
        <p>We each are responsible for our own costs relating to counsel, experts, and witnesses, as well as any other costs relating to the arbitration. However, <?php echo $config['product_name'];?>, will cover any arbitration administrative or filing fee above: (a) $25 if You are seeking less than $1,000 from <?php echo $config['product_name'];?>, ; or (b) the equivalent court filing fees for a court action in the appropriate jurisdiction if you are seeking $1,000 or more from us.</p><br>
        <p>No Class Actions TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CONSOLIDATED OR CLASS-WIDE BASIS; THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING. </p><br>
        <p>No Trial By Jury TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING. </p><br>
        <h3>GOVERNING LAW </h3>
        <p>You agree that this Agreement and any issue or dispute arising out of or otherwise related to this Agreement or with Your use of our Website, Intellectual Property, the Terms of Use, the Privacy Statement, or any matter concerning <?php echo $config['product_name'];?>, shall be governed exclusively by the laws of State of <?php echo $config['company_state']?>, excluding its conflict of law provisions.</p><br>
        <h3>SEVERABILITY </h3>
        <p>If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, the Terms of Use, the Privacy Statement, or any portion thereof, to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remainder of the Agreement, the Terms of Use, and the Privacy Statement will continue in full force and effect. </p><br>
        <h3>NO WAIVER </h3>
        <p>No waiver of or by <?php echo $config['product_name'];?>, shall be deemed a waiver of any subsequent default of the same provision of this Agreement. If any term, clause or provision hereof is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the validity or operation of any other term, clause or provision and such invalid term, clause or provision shall be deemed to be severed from this Agreement. </p><br>
        <h3>HEADINGS </h3>
        <p>All headings are solely for the convenience of reference and shall not affect the meaning, construction or effect of this Agreement.</p><br>
        <h3>COMPLETE AGREEMENT </h3>
        <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to Your access and use of the Website and Your ordering and use of the Products, and supersedes and replaces all prior understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matters.</p><br>
